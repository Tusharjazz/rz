# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
`If I had more time then I would add dark mode to this layout to make it a little more easy on the eyes of the users and dark mode saves battery in most of the phones as most of the mobile phones now a days use OLED displays. I would add animations or color change on hover as well`

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
`I am proud of trying to keep the code as clean and readable as possible while doing this test because readability is an important aspect of writing the code. If your code is very readable then any other developer can easily read the code and understand it. Easily readable and clean code is easy to debug, easy to maintain and easy to extend.`

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
`I spent most of my time with the CSS as I am a detail oriented person, my aim was to match the frontend design exactly to the design that was provided to me.`

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
`The test was really good and very much detail oriented. I did not have any issues completing the test as it was setup very well.`
